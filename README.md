> **Updates:** jsPsychSheet has been update to version 2! Now you do not need to host the experiment page on Google AppScript Domain. You can simply host it as GitHub pages or use you own custom domain.
>
> **Note:** If you are still using jsPsychSheet version 1, make sure you make the necessary change. See [here](tutorials/using-version-1.md).

# jsPsychSheet

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
The pandemic allowed us to explore the benefits of shifting behavioral online because of the lockdown and social distancing norms. Online experiments have several other advantages. It gives us the possibility of recruiting a massive number of subjects from different regions around the world. Additionally, it also provides us with the opportunity of sharing the experiment paradigm with other researchers, leading to more open and reproducible research. But collecting behavioral data from online experiments could be a tedious task, requiring researchers to command HTML, JavaScript, and server-side coding skills. Buying a server to store experimental data also requires additional setup costs for the researcher. <a href="https://www.jspsych.org/">jsPsych</a> is one of the popular JavaScript libraries that provide several packages to ease the design of behavioral experiments in a web browser without having high-level knowledge of HTML and JavaScript. But the researcher still needs to command their server-side coding skills to save the data to an online database. <b>jsPsychSheet</b> is a tiny JavaScript library that solves this problem by providing a quick 2-min recipe to store the experiment data from jsPsych to <a href="https://www.google.com/sheets/about/">Google Sheets</a>. Google Sheets is a handy online spreadsheet provided by Google free of cost. The data from google sheet can later be download as a CSV file.
