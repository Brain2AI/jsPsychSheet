# Support for jsPsychSheet version 1

We recommend you to adjust your code according to version 2, it won't take more than 1 minute to adjust your code.
But if you are still interested in using the version 1, make sure you follow following two things:

* All the version 1 codes are available on GitHub branch `jsPsychSheetV1`. Please refer to the instructions and tutorials written on that branch if you are using version 1.
* If you were using jsPsych and jsPsychSheet libraries hosted on `brain2ai.in` domain. Host the `jsPsychSheetV1` codes in your personal GitHub account as GitHub pages and replace `brain2ai.in` with your GitHub page link. For example: `https://username.github.io/`
